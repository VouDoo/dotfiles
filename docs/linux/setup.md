## Before you start

This guide will assist you in setting up your Linux environment based on **Arch Linux** Linux distribution.

> Arch Linux is my distribution of choice for several key reasons:
>
> - Its minimalist approach allows me to customize the system exactly to my needs, without any unnecessary bloat.
> - The rolling release model ensures I always have access to the latest software updates.
> - The documentation is excellent and very helpful.
> - Installing and maintaining Arch is a more hands-on experience than many other distributions.
>
> Learn more about ["The Arch Way"](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_terminology#The_Arch_Way) and how it defines the Arch philosophy!

## How to install Arch Linux

> As we all know, installing Arch Linux can feel like a rite of passageâ€¦ if that passage involves a maze and a few panic attacks, especially for newbies.
>
> But fear not! With a magical installer, you can now skip the hair-pulling, headache-inducing parts and get straight to the fun stuff!
