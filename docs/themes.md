# Themes

I strive to apply the RosÃ© Pine (Moon) theme to GUI components whenever possible.
This theme is described as:

> _All natural pine, faux fur and a bit of soho vibes for the classy minimalist._

You can explore the collection of personalization settings for various applications here: <https://rosepinetheme.com/>

For my development environment, however, I sometimes prefer the Gruvbox theme, so I may use that instead: <https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox>
