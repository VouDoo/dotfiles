# Archived files

_I archived the files based on their application or usage so that I can retrieve them if I ever need them again..._

The archive directories are located relative to the home directory.

Archive directories with description:

- [neovim_basic](./neovim_basic): Very basic Neovim configuration.
- [qtile_x](./qtile_x): Qtile based on X window system.
